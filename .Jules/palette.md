## 2024-05-22 - HUD Accessibility
**Learning:** The HUD was missing a pause button entirely for touch users, relying on keyboard 'Escape'. Also progress bars lacked ARIA roles.
**Action:** Always check that tutorial instructions ("Tap ⏸ to Pause") align with actual UI elements. Avoid running `pnpm install` in restricted environments to prevent rollbacks.
