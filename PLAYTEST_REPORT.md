# Playtest Report: Brand Identity Simulation

## Executive Summary
This report simulates user experience scenarios for two potential brand identities for the unified game project: **Rivermarsh** and **Rivers of Reckoning**. The game combines exploration (Rivermarsh core) with RPG elements (Rivers of Reckoning) and racing (Otter River Rush).

## Scenario 1: "Rivermarsh"
**Target Audience:** Explorers, Cozy Gamers, Survival Enthusiasts.
**Brand Promise:** An immersive, atmospheric journey through a living wetland ecosystem.

**Player Experience:**
> "I started the game and was immediately drawn in by the water rendering and the ambient sounds. Playing as an otter feels fluid. I spent the first 20 minutes just swimming around, catching fish, and watching the day/night cycle. The UI is minimal but helpful. Finding the 'River Market' was a nice surprise—it felt like a natural part of the world where I could trade my gathered resources. The racing mini-game felt like a playful activity rather than a high-stakes competition. The name 'Rivermarsh' fits perfectly; it feels like a place I want to inhabit."

**Pros:**
- Aligns well with the Strata-powered environmental focus.
- Appeals to the "cozy survival" market (e.g., Subnautica, The Long Dark but less punishing).
- "Marsh" implies biodiversity and exploration.

**Cons:**
- Might sound too passive for players looking for the RPG combat elements.

## Scenario 2: "Rivers of Reckoning"
**Target Audience:** RPG Players, Action-Adventure Fans.
**Brand Promise:** A dramatic saga of survival, growth, and overcoming challenges in a hostile world.

**Player Experience:**
> "The title suggested epic conflict. I was expecting to fight for my territory immediately. The RPG stats (Gold, Level, Skills) confirmed this. I engaged in combat with a predator early on. The quest system gave me clear goals ('Defeat the Marsh Raiders'). However, the peaceful moments of swimming and the beautiful terrain generation felt slightly at odds with the aggressive title. The 'Shop' felt like a war supply depot. The racing mode felt like a chase sequence."

**Pros:**
- Highlights the new RPG systems (Shop, Quests, Combat).
- Sounds cooler and more "game-y".

**Cons:**
- Sets expectations for a combat-heavy game, which might overshadow the exploration and procedural beauty.
- "Reckoning" implies a narrative weight that might not be fully supported by a procedural sandbox yet.

## Recommendation
**Winner: Rivermarsh**

**Rationale:**
The core strength of the project is the **Strata integration** (procedural terrain, water, weather). The game shines as an atmospheric exploration experience. The RPG elements (Shop, Quests) serve to deepen the engagement with the world rather than define it as a combat-focused title. "Rivermarsh" invites players to explore, whereas "Rivers of Reckoning" demands they conquer.

The new "River Market" (Shop) integrates well into "Rivermarsh" as a hub for the ecosystem, rather than an armory.

**Action Taken:**
The codebase has been rebranded to **Rivermarsh**.
