# Project Brief: Rivermarsh

Rivermarsh is a best-in-class mobile-first 3D exploration game built with React Three Fiber, `@jbcom/strata`, and Capacitor.

## Core Vision
Unify three distinct game codebases into one immersive experience:
1.  **Rivermarsh** (Current): Core exploration and procedural world.
2.  **Rivers of Reckoning**: RPG combat, quests, leveling, and spells.
3.  **Otter River Rush**: River racing mini-game and mobile optimization.

## Current State
- **Integration Phase**: Actively porting features from archived source repositories.
- **Rendering**: Fully migrated to `@jbcom/strata` for terrain, water, and weather.
- **Mobile**: First-class support for touch controls and gyroscope camera.
- **RPG Systems**: Combat, Spells, Quests, and Leveling are being integrated into the ECS architecture.

## Primary Goals
- Immersive 3D exploration of procedural wetland biomes.
- Robust RPG progression system.
- High-performance rendering on mid-range mobile devices.
- Seamless unification of combat and racing mechanics.
